B. Simone is joined by Megan Brooks, her co-host from “The Know For Sure Podcast.” Marco asks the ladies what do they want to get out but the ladies can’t get over Marco’s outfit. The ladies talk about their podcast. Marco asks the ladies to describe themselves. The ladies go into how long they have been friends since childhood. Marco continues the interview with random questions and the ladies entertain the questions all while sipping from red cups. Marco brings up outrageous scenarios and the ladies oblige. Marco continues to ask the ladies random questions including why B. Simone used a tv show to find love. Marco and Producer Matt pose a question and Producer Matt has an emotional moment. Marco and the ladies discuss the awkward moment. B. Simone talks about their love of Deion Sanders. Marco continues to ask random questions and the ladies defer to their podcast.

I guess this is the ultimate answer to that question. This M1 Ultra Mac Studio with 20 cores and 64 GPU cores gets tested with Minecraft Single Player worlds, Minecraft TNT explosions and even gets trialed on the Hermitcraft server. \n\nWHY DID I GET A MAC STUDIO?\nI'm not just a Minecraft YouTuber. I'm a filmmaker who works on commercials, narrative and documentaries. I also love to travel, and be out in remote places to shoot photos, hike and explore.\nI wanted a desktop powerhouse that could fit into a single flight case and be transported to any location in the world, allowing me to live and work wherever I want. \n\nThe system needed to:\n1. Run Minecraft at a good enough level to record videos\n2. Handle colour graded cinema camera files, and edit with them no dropped frames.\n3. Have a large number of high speed I/O ports to deal with multiple large data transfers at once. \n4. Be silent for recording audio in potentially small places (This is what ruled out most gaming laptops!)\n5. Fit in a flight case, with the system, display, and flight case combination weighing under 20KG to be within the weight allowance for checked luggage on flights.\n6.

Lightning McQueen was the coolest! Becuase I have a history of building the craziest and best things on YouTube and I recently transformed my old 15 year old car into Lightning McQueen, I thought it woube be awesome to also build Mater and Guido as well! To take things to the next level I surprised my good friend who is obsessed with the movie Cars with them and he was estatic! The Beem Team did amazing work once again and I’m so happy with how it turned out. This was super intense to make, but we had lots of laughs along the way. Thank you for watching! I really appreciate your support! I love making these videos and can't wait for you to see what is next.\n\nIf you’re reading this you’re a real one!\nComment ‘’KAAAA-CHOW!\" so I can notice you!\n\nNot the Best of Lightning McQueen, But Lightning McQueen's Big Crash, But Disney Cars Lightning McQueen in Real Life on Road, But Pixar Play Parade HD 1080p, But Lightning Mcqueen Real Life, But Lightning McQueen Wrap, But Cars on the Road - Cast - TRUCKS, But Movie Cars Made in Real Life, But I Turned My Car Into Lightning McQueen, But Comparison: Cars Characters in Real Life, or any other video like GROM TV, Forceman Cars, Ben Hodge, DisneyMusicVEVO, KinoCheck Family, Pixar, BE AMAZED, Disney, Unspeakable, JStu, Ben Azelart, Stephen Sharer,  Stokes Twins, or Airrack would make. This is a video where Matthew Beem (aka MBeem10 not Matthew Beam) builds real life Lightning McQueen, Mater, and Guido from the Disney Pixar movie Cars!",

Lightning McQueen was the coolest! Becuase I have a history of building the craziest and best things on YouTube and I recently transformed my old 15 year old car into Lightning McQueen, I thought it woube be awesome to also build Mater and Guido as well! To take things to the next level I surprised my good friend who is obsessed with the movie Cars with them and he was estatic! The Beem Team did amazing work once again and I’m so happy with how it turned out. This was super intense to make, but we had lots of laughs along the way. Thank you for watching! I really appreciate your support! I love making these videos and can't wait for you to see what is next.\n\nIf you’re reading this you’re a real one!\nComment ‘’KAAAA-CHOW!\" so I can notice you!\n\nNot the Best of Lightning McQueen, But Lightning McQueen's Big Crash, But Disney Cars Lightning McQueen in Real Life on Road, But Pixar Play Parade HD 1080p, But Lightning Mcqueen Real Life, But Lightning McQueen Wrap, But Cars on the Road - Cast - TRUCKS, But Movie Cars Made in Real Life, But I Turned My Car Into Lightning McQueen, But Comparison: Cars Characters in Real Life, or any other video like GROM TV, Forceman Cars, Ben Hodge, DisneyMusicVEVO, KinoCheck Family, Pixar, BE AMAZED, Disney, Unspeakable, JStu, Ben Azelart, Stephen Sharer,  Stokes Twins, or Airrack would make. This is a video where Matthew Beem (aka MBeem10 not Matthew Beam) builds real life Lightning McQueen, Mater, and Guido from the Disney Pixar movie Cars!"

There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“ROBUX”).
